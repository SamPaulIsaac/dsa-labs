# 🧠 DSA Labs

A structured collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts, implementations, and problem-solving patterns.  
Designed for **deep learning**, **coding interviews**, and building strong **system-level thinking**.

## 🎯 Goals
  - Understand core DSA concepts with concise explanations and examples
  - Build reusable code templates for key problem types
  - Prepare for system design and high-performance coding interviews
  - Transition from concept to code through hands-on labs

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This repo is actively evolving as part of a focused DSA mastery phase.

## 🛠️ Setup
Each directory is self-contained with:

  - ✅ Concept Notes (.md files)
  - ✅ Java code implementations (.java)
  - ✅ Practice problems (problem-*.java or folders)

No external dependencies are required beyond standard Java SDK.
